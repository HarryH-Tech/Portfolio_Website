<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

**This is a website to display some of my side projects. I made it so I could learn more about deploying a live site, how to deploy react/node applications in production rather than on localhost.<br /><br />If you want to modify this site for any reason feel free to do so. Just run `git clone https://github.com/HarryH-Tech/Website` in the directory you wish to clone the repo into then navigate into the folder and open the `index.html` file in the default browser and you should see the website displayed the same as below. Unfortunately you won't be able to view the side projects within it on your default browser, to do that you'll have to go to the actual website [here](https://www.harryh.tech/)**

**If you have any recommendations for how I could improve it or any of the applications on it I'd love to hear them. You can contact me using the contact form on the site.**
